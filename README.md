# 📚 Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to document my journey in learning JavaScript. I'll be sharing my notes and code snippets here, which I hope will be helpful for beginners diving into JavaScript. Whether you're new to programming or looking to brush up on your skills, you're in the right place! 🔥

# 🎯 Why?
I believe in the power of sharing knowledge. By documenting my learning process, I aim to make JavaScript more accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or time constraints. Additionally, maintaining this repository allows me to have a quick reference to JavaScript concepts whenever I need them. After all, learning shouldn't be confined to just one moment—it's an ongoing journey!

# 📝 Resources Used
I've been following the "JavaScript One Shot" course by the legendary Hitesh Choudhary. This course has been instrumental in shaping my understanding of JavaScript concepts, and I'll be referencing it throughout this repository.

Let's learn and grow together! Happy coding! 🚀
